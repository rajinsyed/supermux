/// End-to-end gate for remote-tmux mirror sizing, against a REAL tmux server.
///
/// Sizing spans a full round trip (container pixels → pushed client size →
/// tmux's per-pane assignment → imposed frames → rendered grids), and defects
/// live in the interactions between those stages — invisible to unit tests of
/// any single stage. This suite drives the real loop end to end and asserts
/// the two invariants that define "settled":
///
///   1. STABILITY: after any disturbance, the client size converges to a
///      single value and stays there (no oscillation, no churn).
///   2. COHERENCE: client == every window's size, and a split window's
///      top-row pane widths + one separator per gap == the window width.
///
/// Hermetic by construction: a throwaway tmux server runs on an isolated
/// socket directory, and the app is launched with
/// `CMUX_REMOTE_TMUX_SSH_FOR_TESTING` pointing at a shim that strips the ssh
/// framing and execs the remote command locally — the full mirror stack runs
/// with no sshd and no network. Skips when no tmux binary is present (CI
/// installs one in the e2e workflow's dependency step).
