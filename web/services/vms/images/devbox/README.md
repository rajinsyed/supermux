# cmux Cloud devbox image (Freestyle)

The devbox definition for cmux Cloud machines. The Dockerfile here is the
reference recipe (container providers used to build it directly);
`web/scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts` builds the same devbox on top of
the `freestyle/ubuntu` base VM and adds the **desktop layer** from
`desktop/`. Parity targets are the chatmux
devbox (`chatmux:infra/sandbox-images/Dockerfile`): same devtools,
node/python/bun, uv, gh, Chrome + cua-driver, pinned coding agents, ble.sh
ghost text, half-life prompt, seeded history, and the coderouter
agent-config generator.

On Freestyle the toolchain is the base's, not mise: `freestyle/ubuntu`
already ships Node LTS under nvm (symlinked into `/usr/local/bin`), Bun,
Python 3.12, uv, Docker (running from boot), and its own copies of Claude
Code, Codex and OpenCode. The bake keeps all of that and replaces the agent
copies with the exact Dockerfile pins (`npm install -g` on the base's npm,
every agent bin symlinked into `/usr/local/bin` so daemon panes resolve them
without a login profile). The work user is the base's **`ubuntu`** (uid
1000, passwordless sudo, the API's default exec user and the SSH default);
the bake creates no users. A cmux login banner (`cmux-motd`, rendered by
pam_motd on SSH) replaces the stock Ubuntu and Freestyle motd text.

`vm-devbox-image.test.ts` pins the shared files (`cmux-bashrc`,
`agent-config.sh`, `seed-history`, `chrome-managed-policy.json`) to their
chatmux counterparts, so edit both copies together.

## Desktop layer (`desktop/`, Freestyle)

Ported from the retired Blaxel `sandbox/cmux-devbox` image: an
openbox/TigerVNC desktop with a tint2 dock (Chrome, Files, Ghostty), a CC0
wallpaper, and noVNC on 6901. The contract the Mac CLI and any provider
heal depend on (`vm-devbox-desktop.test.ts` pins it):

- `start-vnc.sh` runs as the work user `ubuntu` with `HOME=/home/ubuntu`
  and `DISPLAY=:1`, so the desktop session is the same account terminals
  and SSH land in; RFB on **5901 loopback-only** (no VNC auth; the only
  ingress is a token-gated proxy in front of websockify), noVNC via
  websockify on **6901** at `/`.
- The `cmux-desktop` systemd unit runs `cmux-desktop-boot`, which re-asserts
  Chrome's pre-accepted first run and re-runs the idempotent `start-vnc.sh`
  every 30 s.
- `ubuntu` has passwordless sudo, so coding agents' root-refusing modes
  (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) work. The Freestyle driver still
  runs the cmux-tui daemon as root; moving sessions to `ubuntu` is a driver
  change.
- Ghostty comes from a pinned community `.deb` for Ubuntu 24.04
  (`DEVBOX_GHOSTTY_DEB_URL` in `devbox-image-common.ts`).

A desktop image is a superset of a base one, so one Freestyle snapshot is
registered under both kinds (`desktop` and `base`). `--no-desktop` bakes a
shell-only snapshot. Not yet wired: the Freestyle driver still runs the
daemon as root and exposes no ingress to 6901 (a `style.dev` or
`*.vm.cmux.sh` TLS rule is the intended path; see `desktopWrapper.ts`).

## Session daemon: cmux-tui

Machines attach through the cmux-tui remote daemon on port 1337
(transport `cmux-remote`, docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md). The binary is NOT
baked: the driver installs the pinned files.cmux.com build
(sha256-verified) at create time and heals pin drift on attach
(`web/services/vms/drivers/cmuxTuiDaemon.ts`). The image ships only
`cmux-devbox-boot`, the supervisor that waits for the binary and restarts
the daemon, run by the baked `cmux-tui-daemon` systemd unit with
`CMUX_TUI_REMOTE_WS_BIND=[::]:1337` (the driver reaches the daemon at the
VM's IPv6 address, so the listener must be dual-stack).

Shells spawned by the daemon get the bash devshell (ble.sh ghost text,
half-life prompt, seeded history) through the `/etc/bash.bashrc` chain.

## Promote: bake, verify, record (one command)

The checked-in manifest (`web/services/vms/images/manifest.json`) is the
only source of truth for the image users get: the resolver serves the entry
flagged `defaultForKind`, in local dev and every deployed runtime alike, and
no env var selects or overrides it. `promote-devbox-image.ts` is the only
sanctioned writer:

```bash
# from web/, with the Freestyle key in env
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --image sh-…   # verify + record an existing snapshot
```

Snapshots are account-scoped: promote under the Freestyle account the
deployment's `FREESTYLE_API_KEY` belongs to, or the recorded id is
unreachable from production.

It runs the stale-checkout preflight (`CMUX_BAKE_ALLOW_BRANCH=1` for
deliberate branch bakes), the bake, then `verify-devbox-image.ts`; only a
passing verify writes the manifest, appending one entry per kind flagged
`defaultForKind` while demoting the provider's previous defaults. Existing
entries are never removed, so rollback is a manifest revert. It also moves the
`cmux-devbox` snapshot slug onto the new id as a dashboard convenience;
production boots from the immutable `sh-…` id, never the slug. The last
stdout line is `IMAGE_ID <id>`; `--out <json>` writes the summary.
Commit the manifest diff in a PR; merging it is the promotion.

## Bake and verify by hand

Each script refuses a stale checkout (`CMUX_BAKE_ALLOW_BRANCH=1` for
deliberate branch bakes). No local Docker and no daemon build are needed.

```bash
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts cmux-devbox-<tag> [--no-desktop] [--replace-slug]
```

Freestyle bakes on `freestyle/ubuntu` (4 vCPU / 8 GiB / 32 GB): VMs always
boot at their snapshot's size and resizing is grow-only, so the builder's
shape is what every cmux Cloud machine gets. Freestyle snapshot slugs are
reassignable; the printed `sh-…` id is the pointer to pin. Agent pins live
only in the Dockerfile ARG defaults; bump them together with
`CMUX_IMAGE_EPOCH` and the chatmux template. The cmux-tui pin comes from
the artifacts manifest at deploy time (`CMUX_VM_CMUX_TUI_MANIFEST_URL`),
never from the image.

Each bake prints a `next` command. The verifier boots one VM from the
snapshot, asserts the toolchain, the exact agent pins, ghost text
under a tmux PTY, byte-identical baked files, the work user, and (when
`/etc/cmux/image-stamp` says `desktop`) the desktop contract, then replays
the driver's create-time cmux-tui bootstrap and asserts the daemon contract,
and deletes the sandbox:

```bash
bun scripts/verify-devbox-image.ts freestyle <sh-snapshot-id>
```

Only after verify passes may an entry carry `validationStatus: "passed"`;
`vm-image-manifest.test.ts` refuses a `defaultForKind` entry with any other
status. Machines created from the old cmuxd-remote images cannot serve the
`cmux-remote` transport and need recreation on a devbox image.
