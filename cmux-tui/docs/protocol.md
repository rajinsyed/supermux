# Control Socket Protocol

As of protocol v6, every server speaks JSON Lines over a Unix domain socket. Send one JSON object per line. Every request receives one response line. `subscribe` and `attach-surface` also push event lines on the same connection.

For shell use, prefer `cmux-tui <verb>`; it wraps the same socket commands and preserves JSON output with `--json`.

Default socket path:

```text
$TMPDIR/cmux-tui-<uid>/<session>.sock
```

`identify` reports the protocol version:

```json
{"id":1,"cmd":"identify"}
{"id":1,"ok":true,"data":{"app":"cmux-tui","version":"...","protocol":6,"session":"main","pid":12345}}
```

Responses have this shape:

```json
{"id":1,"ok":true,"data":{}}
{"id":2,"ok":false,"error":"unknown surface 99"}
```

Bad JSON returns `ok:false` with no request id.

## Command Contract

The full API contract is intended to live in `cmux-tui/spec/`, but that directory is not present in this checkout. Until it lands, `cmux-tui-core/src/server.rs` is the command source of truth.

The server command set in this branch is:

```text
identify
list-workspaces
send
read-screen
vt-state
new-tab
new-browser-tab
new-workspace
new-screen
split
set-ratio
move-tab
move-workspace
set-default-colors
close-surface
close-pane
close-screen
close-workspace
rename-pane
rename-surface
rename-screen
rename-workspace
resize-surface
focus-pane
select-tab
select-screen
select-workspace
browser-mouse
browser-wheel
browser-key
browser-insert-text
browser-navigate
browser-back
browser-forward
browser-reload
browser-activate
subscribe
attach-surface
scroll-surface
```

`move-tab` moves a surface to a target pane and insertion index. It supports same-pane reorder and cross-pane moves.

```json
{"id":10,"cmd":"move-tab","surface":4,"pane":2,"index":0}
```

`move-workspace` moves a workspace to an insertion index.

```json
{"id":11,"cmd":"move-workspace","workspace":3,"index":0}
```

## Events

`subscribe` starts event streaming:

```json
{"id":20,"cmd":"subscribe"}
```

Response data is `{}`. Future event lines may interleave with responses.

Subscribed event lines are:

```json
{"event":"surface-output","surface":4}
{"event":"surface-resized","surface":4,"cols":120,"rows":40}
{"event":"surface-exited","surface":4}
{"event":"title-changed","surface":4}
{"event":"bell","surface":4}
{"event":"tree-changed"}
{"event":"empty"}
```

`surface-resized` reports the final clamped cell size and is emitted only when the surface size actually changes.

Browser input, navigation, activation, and browser reconfigure work from `resize-surface` enqueue per-surface CDP work and return `ok:true` after acceptance. Completion or failure is observed later via browser state and status events. Two consecutive CDP call timeouts mark only that browser surface failed with `browser is not responding`.

## Attach Surface

`attach-surface` streams a PTY or browser surface.

```json
{"id":30,"cmd":"attach-surface","surface":4}
```

The server first sends:

```json
{"event":"vt-state","surface":4,"cols":120,"rows":40,"data":"<base64-vt-replay>"}
```

Then it sends ordered stream frames:

```json
{"event":"output","surface":4,"data":"<base64-pty-bytes>"}
{"event":"resized","surface":4,"cols":132,"rows":43,"data":"<base64-vt-replay>"}
```

The `resized` attach frame carries the new cell size and a fresh VT replay captured at that size. It is delivered in the same attach stream as output frames, so a client can reset its local terminal, apply the replay, and continue consuming later output in order.

For browser surfaces, the server first sends `browser-state` with URL, title, size, status, stalled-frame state, and the latest PNG frame if one exists. Later updates send `browser-state` and `frame` events. Frame payloads are base64 PNG data and slow clients skip older frames rather than buffering unboundedly.

When the stream ends, it sends:

```json
{"event":"detached","surface":4}
```

## Client Compatibility

The remote TUI requires protocol v6. It refuses servers reporting any other protocol version because attach streams need resize markers carrying replay data.

Attach clients mirror PTY surfaces locally. On first render, a client can resize the server surface before requesting `attach-surface`, so the initial VT replay is captured at the visible geometry.

When several attach clients render the same surface at different sizes, sizing follows latest local interaction. A client reasserts its visible sizes after key input, mouse input, paste, focus gained, or terminal resize. Mux-driven redraws update local mirrors from `surface-resized` without reasserting an idle client's viewport.

## Browser Limitations

Browser surfaces appear in `list-workspaces` as `kind: "browser"` with `browser_source: "external"` or `"launched"` once live, plus additive `browser_status`, `browser_error`, and `browser_frames_stalled` fields. PTY and VT commands against browser surfaces return errors.
