# cmux TUI PR intent and merge board

Audit date: 2026-08-24. This board records the GitHub search and exact check
state used for the aggregate merge. A mergeable label is not acceptance proof.
The aggregate branch currently includes the exact-head autoreview fixes and
cross-platform hardening through `17413db11cc0ebb7b0b5c254447cede3faaad0cf`;
the reviewer must be rerun at the final pushed head.
All URLs point to `manaflow-ai/cmux`; authors are included for merge decisions.

The latest exact-head autoreview is clean for in-scope changes. It reported
two remote-tmux findings, both ignored because they are outside this
aggregate's cmux-tui, SDK, relay, and preview scope. The wave also includes
the Go canonical fallback correction, C++ exact-parent/CMake include fix,
bounded Rust workspace reads, watcher sink termination, and preview/shell
ownership fixes. These are documented with full commit SHAs and exact revert
commands in `TECH-DEBT-CHANGELOG.md`.

## Aggregate

| PR | Author | Intent | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#10603](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10603) | Lawrence Chen | Umbrella relay, SDK, TUI lifecycle, protocol, and tech-debt integration. | This branch supersedes the overlapping slices. Merge only after exact-head hosted checks and local autoreview pass. |
| [#10602](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10602) | Lawrence Chen | Earlier relay tech-debt wave. | Superseded by #10603. It remains open; do not merge. Its Rust SDK MSRV, Rust consumer, and Rust package checks failed in run `32644656010`. |
| [#10571](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10571) | Lawrence Chen | Earlier chatmux-relay slices 2 and 3. | Closed as superseded by #10603. |

## Dependency chains that are not safe to merge blindly

| PR | Author | Intent and required order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#10413](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10413) | Lawrence Chen | Journal topology restore. Merge only after an exact rebase and hosted checks. |
| [#10521](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10521) | Lawrence Chen | Journal restore apply v1, dependent on #10413. Rebase after the base lands, then prove lifecycle, atomic exit state, replay performance, and metadata privacy. |
| [#10428](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10428) | Lawrence Chen | Scoped attach passthrough. It is conflicting and its diagnostic PTY tap has blocking-I/O and process-group risks. Rebase and remove or repair the tap before merge. |
| [#10513](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10513) | Lawrence Chen | Host and daemon death reporting. It depends on #10428 and needs a rebase plus focused hosted tests. |
| [#10253](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10253), [#10267](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10267), [#10268](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10268), [#10269](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10269) | Lawrence Chen | Release and wheel verification stack. Merge bottom-up only after each exact head passes. |
| [#10261](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10261), [#10262](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10262), [#10264](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10264), [#10265](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10265) | Lawrence Chen | SDK integration stack. Merge bottom-up, then rerun all language consumers. |

## Independent candidates

These PRs were mergeable or near-ready in the audit, but they are not part of
the aggregate branch. Merge them separately only after checking the current
head and overlap with #10603.

- [#10607](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10607), Lawrence Chen, identity and protocol preflight.
- [#10537](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10537), dkta0, client-local host colors.
- [#10318](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10318), Lawrence Chen, pane-context New-column action.
- [#10302](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10302), Lawrence Chen, multiple machine providers.
- [#10271](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10271), Lawrence Chen, explicit skipped-TUI coverage.
- [#10249](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10249), Lawrence Chen, SDK session validation.
- [#10239](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10239), Lawrence Chen, unsafe session-name rejection.

## Defer or rebase

- [#10321](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10321), Lawrence Chen, cloud TUI. Large and conflicting, so it needs a product and security review.
- [#10270](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10270), Lawrence Chen, long socket hashing. Checks passed but the branch conflicts and overlaps #10249.
- [#10243](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10243), Lawrence Chen, release orchestration. Conflicting and outside this aggregate's safe scope.
- [#10136](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10136), Lawrence Chen, journal restore. Use the current recut [#10259](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10259) instead.
- [#10214](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10214), Lawrence Chen, Windows launch. Functionally superseded by [#10266](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10266).
- [#9515](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9515), Abdulaziz Albahar, Iroh transport. Experimental and requires an independent protocol/security review.
- [#9524](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9524), Abdulaziz Albahar, Iroh transport follow-up. Same defer rule.
- [#9593](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9593), Abdulaziz Albahar, Iroh transport stack. Same defer rule.

## Audit limits

The search used GitHub TUI title/body filters plus known dependency links. It
can miss work that never says TUI or cmux in its title or body. The board does
not close or merge unrelated experimental work. A PR with a green old check is
not current-head evidence; conflicting branches require a rebase first.
