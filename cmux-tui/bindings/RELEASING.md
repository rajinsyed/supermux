# cmux-tui SDK releases

The cmux-tui SDKs share one version and one going-forward tag:

```bash
cmux-sdk-vX.Y.Z
```

Historical releases used `mux-sdk-vX.Y.Z`; the publish workflows still accept
that prefix so old release history remains connected. These tags are separate
from app release tags such as `vX.Y.Z`. Current SDK package versions are
`1.0.0`.

## Support matrix

| SDK | Minimum toolchain/runtime | Runtime dependencies | Distribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | Node.js 20; browser ESM for the browser entry | none | npm package |
| Python | CPython 3.9 | none | PyPI wheel and source distribution |
| Rust | Rust 1.88 | base: `base64`, `getrandom`, `libc`, `serde`, `serde_json`; sidebar: `crossterm`, `ratatui`, `serde_json` | crates.io crates `cmux-client` and `cmux-sidebar` |
| Go | Go 1.22 | standard library only | Go module tag |
| Java | Java 17 | standard library only | Maven artifact |
| C++ | C++20 and CMake 3.20 | standard library and platform socket APIs | installable CMake package |
| Zig | Zig 0.15.2 | standard library only | source package |

All packages target mux protocol 10 and expose the same 92 commands and 45
events. The shared conformance suite verifies their common wire behavior.

## One-time registry setup

- PyPI: create or claim the `cmux` project, then add a trusted publisher for
  `manaflow-ai/cmux`, workflow `.github/workflows/sdk-publish-python.yml`, and
  environment `pypi`. The workflow uses OIDC trusted publishing and PyPI
  attestations, so no PyPI token is stored in GitHub.
- crates.io: publish or claim the first `cmux-client` and `cmux-sidebar` releases
  manually if crates.io still requires initial releases, then add trusted
  publishers for owner `manaflow-ai`, repo `cmux`, workflow
  `.github/workflows/sdk-publish-crates.yml`, and environment `crates-io`. The
  workflow exchanges GitHub OIDC for a short-lived crates.io token via
  `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action`. It publishes `cmux-client`, waits for that
  version to reach the crates.io index, then publishes `cmux-sidebar`.
- npm: configure trusted publishing and required 2FA policy for package `cmux`,
  workflow `.github/workflows/sdk-publish-npm.yml`, and environment `npm`.
  Warning: the live npm package name `cmux` is currently a different cloud-VM CLI
  package. Publishing the SDK to that name is a deliberate coordinated breaking
  move; the npm workflow never publishes on tag push and requires manual
  `workflow_dispatch` with `confirm_npm_cmux: true`.
- Maven Central: verify the `com.cmux` namespace in Central Portal, add complete
  Maven metadata, configure GPG signing, and decide the Central publishing
  workflow. Java publishing is intentionally a CI stub until those prerequisites
  are done.
- Go: there is no registry publish step. Once the tag exists, users can install
  with `go get github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/cmux-tui/bindings/go@cmux-sdk-vX.Y.Z`.
- C++: install the CMake package from source or consume a release archive. The
  installed target is `cmux::sdk`.
- Zig: use the release source tree as a package dependency with Zig 0.15.2.

## Cutting a release

1. Update TypeScript, Python, both Rust crate manifests, Java, C++, and Zig
   package metadata to the same version. Zig's authoritative package version is
   `zig/build.zig.zon`; keep the example executable version in `zig/build.zig`
   identical. Go follows the shared Git tag.
2. Verify synchronized versions:

   ```bash
   python3 cmux-tui/bindings/check-versions.py --expected X.Y.Z
   ```
3. Run the cmux-tui binding tests locally or wait for `.github/workflows/cmux-tui.yml` on
   the release PR. The publish workflows also run the language conformance gate
   before publishing.
4. Merge the version bump.
5. Create and push the namespaced SDK tag:

   ```bash
   git tag cmux-sdk-vX.Y.Z
   git push origin cmux-sdk-vX.Y.Z
   ```

6. Watch the SDK workflows. Python and Rust publish automatically after their
   conformance gates pass. Rust publishes `cmux-client` before `cmux-sidebar`.
   Go validates only. Java reports the Maven Central TODO. npm validates on tag
   push but does not publish until a maintainer runs `sdk publish npm` manually
   with `confirm_npm_cmux: true`.

## Safety checks

Each SDK workflow is triggered by `cmux-sdk-v*` tags, legacy `mux-sdk-v*` tags,
or `workflow_dispatch`. The version guard extracts `X.Y.Z` from the tag, or uses
the manual `version` input, and fails unless the TypeScript, Python, and both
Rust package manifest versions all match.

Publish jobs use least-privilege permissions. OIDC-capable registries use
`id-token: write` only on the publish job. No long-lived registry tokens are
committed or required for PyPI, crates.io, or npm trusted publishing. PyPI uses
PEP 740 attestations; npm publishes with provenance. All GitHub Actions `uses:`
entries are pinned to full commit SHAs.
